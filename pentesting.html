          <h1>Penetration Testing</h1>
          <p>
            Penetration testing is like an art form. Every artists have their
            way of "art", how they brush their paint brush on the canvas, how
            they see a painting, how they make it come alive. The same is with
            penetration-testing. Everyone has a style. Everyone has their
            toolkit. However, as penetration testers, "hackers", our brushes are
            terminals, and our color palletes are tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />So, In this section of my webpage, I introduce penetration
            testing and my art form, how I paint. Each one of us has a style, a
            way of thinking, and by the end of each topic I cover, I hope you
            can see my painting come alive, understand it the way I do, and
            learn something from it. I encourage to think outside the box, how
            each activity I do, or action I perform, how can this be improved?
            How can this be engineered better? That's what makes us better.
            Always remember to step outside your comfort zone, learn something
            that you don't understand, learn something outside your comfort
            zone.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />While I'm no where near a grand master at this field I love
            the thrill of learning, trying to study something that I've not been
            in good terms with, something I find hard to grasp, Assembly
            language being one (lol). However, after time, it comes to you, you
            begin to understand. Don't be afraid to not understand, don't throw
            it away quicky and set it aside for another day, learn.

            <br />Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel took an enormous amount of time
            to complete, by a single artist, Michelangelo himself. It was done
            in two phases. The first phase was the magnificent ceiling frescos
            between 1508-1512 and the second was the Last Judgment executed many
            years later from 1535-1541.

          />
          <p>
            <br />Above we can see Adam touching the hand of God. That image
            itself is one of the most popular pieces in the world, surrounded by
            Michelangelo's work.
          </p>

            <br />My point is, to be the best and do the best, it needs time and
            experience. Rome wasn't built in a day. Keep going. Learn. I hope
            you find my page useful. I hope you become who you want to.
