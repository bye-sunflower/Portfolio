        <h1>CCNA</h1>
        <p>
          I took the CCNA certification back in early March 2022. First time, I
          failed. I knew why. Before starting my position as a cybersecurity
          analyst, I was stuyding Network+ for my knowlege in networking, which
          is a entry level certificate from CompTIA. I was almost done with it
          before joining my new job and had plans on taking it around January
          2022 before moving on to fully spending all my study hours on OSCP.<br /><br />Failing
          was hard.<br /><br />I knew where I failed. I took the time to focus
          on those certain topics. The thing that threw me off the most was the
          fact on how much different it was compared to the Network+ exam. Most
          of the stuff was hands-on, but that's what I liked most about it. It
          didn't fill you with unecessary knowlege on fire alarms (joke).
          <br /><br />Anyways, I took it a month later and passed. While this
          wasn't the hardest exams I've done, this was definetly the most
          stressful one as I've never been pushed to take an exam that quick. My
          manager wanted it done in 1 month... Got it done in just around ~4.

        <p>
          I quite enjoyed this exam. This was definetly on the easy side, with a
          LOT of enumeration. I enjoyed this particular one as it was varied. As
          I cannot give too much away I will not give details on what I
          experienced during the exam but It's good to know your enumeration
          techiniques.<br /><br />I completed the exam in around ~4 hours and
          they gave me 3 days to do so. This was my first exam I took in regards
          to penetration-testing and it deffinetely conviced me to pay the price
          of taking them.<br /><br />INE has a course called Penetration Testing
          Student (PTS) which is a course designed to specifically focus on this
          exam and is FREE! I definetly used resources from here and I'd
          encourage you to do the same if you're planning on taking it. I'd
          treat this as close at it comes to an actual penetration test, not
          just a regular CTF you get on TryHackMe or HackTheBox, because that's
          what the exam is about.<br /><br />Anyway, I'd recommend to do a lot
          of CTF's to get the hang of enumeration and develop a mindset to
          "hacking" as this will help out a LOT. I wish you the best of luck
          towards it.
