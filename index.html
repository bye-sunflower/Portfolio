                <h1>Hello.</h1>
                <p>My name is Ervin. I'm 21 years of age. I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast. I remember started programming back in ~2014, and that's what kicked my interest in the computer science field. I vaguely remember my first lines of code being:</p>
                    <div class="code-block">
                        <p class="first-line">print("Hello, World!")</p>
                        <p>x = 1</p>
                        <p>while(x < 11):</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(x)</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x += 1</p>
                    </div>
                <p>I remember seeing Mr. Robot for the first time back when my friend told me about the show, before then, I didn't know anything with regards to hacking. I've heard of code sanitizsation for avoiding Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL-Injections (SQLi) and the rest. I found ethical hacking even more exciting than programming, I guess it was an excitement for breaking things rather than building them. 2 years down the line, I work as a cybersecurity analyst, working and studying hard towards being a penetration tester.</p>
                <p><br>Anyways, I've made this page to note down my studies and help anyone along the way. This will mostly consist of notes and learning material on various fields of penetration testing, from network to binary exploitation, from Python to Assembly. I hope you find it useful as much as I do. <br><br></p>
