            <h1>CCNA</h1>
            <p>I took the CCNA certification back in early March 2022. First time, I failed. I knew why. Before starting my position as a cybersecurity analyst, I was stuyding Network+ for my knowlege in networking, which is a entry level certificate from CompTia. I was almost done with it before joining my new job and had plans on taking it around January 2022 before moving on to fully spending all my study hours on OSCP.<br><br>Failing was hard.<br><br>I knew where I failed. I took the time to focus on those certain topics. The thing that threw me off the most was the fact on how much different it was compared to the Network+ exam. Most of the stuff was hands-on, but that's what I liked most about it. It didn't fill you with unecessary knowlege on fire alarms (joke). <br><br>Anyways, I took it a month later and passed. While this wasn't the hardest exams I've done, this was definetly the most stressful one as I've never been pushed to take an exam that quick. My manager wanted it done in 1 month... Got it done in just around ~4.</p>
